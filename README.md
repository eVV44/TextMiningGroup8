This repository contains the work from the Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Text Mining course, where we explored foundational concepts in linguistics and NLP. Topics covered include rule-based systems, machine learning, deep learning, text classification, sentiment analysis, entity recognition, and topic modeling. We worked on implementing and evaluating text mining techniques, adapting them to specific domains.
